# Qual Professor?
Qual Professor means Which Professor and it's a game where the user chooses a professor and the system tries to guess the right professor based on the answers (yes/no) given by the user.

# Why?
It was created for an Artificial Intelligence course. 
We wanted to create something that would be fun for all Computer Science students and professors (from Unesp Bauru) play.

# How you developed it?
It was developed by me and Elisa Castro. We created all the algorithms in JavaScript (using jQuery) and a JSON to store the knowledge needed by the system. And of course HTML and CSS.

# Can I play it?
Yeah! It is in portuguese and available at http://giuliacardieri.com/qualprofessor
