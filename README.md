# Qual Professor?
A game created in JavaScript (jQuery), HTML5 and CSS using the concept of a specialist system.

# Why?
It was developed by me and Elisa Castro. We created it for our Artificial Intelligence course. 
We also wanted to create something that would be fun for all Computer Science students and professors (from Unesp Bauru) to play.

# Can I play it?
Yeah! It is in portuguese and available at http://giuliacardieri.com/qualprofessor
